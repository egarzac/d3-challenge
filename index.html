          <h2>POVERTY TRIGGERS BAD HABITS WHICH LEADS TO HIGHER HEALTHCARE RISKS</h2>
          <p>According to Hadit's SCARCITY theorem, people in poverty are more susceptible to smoking and their chances to quite smoking are slim. There are several reasons
            that explain this behaviour.</p>

          <p>For example, people that live in poverty, usually think think more frequently on a short-term basis as they are in a survival mode.
            Hence, they usually underestimate long-term healthcare risks resulting from smoking.</p>

          <p>The probability of a person to quite smoking while living in poverty is quite low. The reason relies on the  tunneling effect which expalins that poeple in poverty focus most of their attention in coming up with
            the rent, food and paying utility bills. This leaves no mind and will energy, both requiered to fight back a bad habit such as smoking.</p>

            <p>It seems the SCARCITY theroem holds true as we can attest in the graph a hight correlation between higher poverty levels and % of the population that smoke.</p>
